# Story

MegaPocket is the third in my series of DIY handheld gaming devices that share the same form factor. Powered by an ATmega32U4, it's a "big screen" Arduboy® game compatible handheld. The 12V boost circuit needed to drive the 2.42 inch OLED has been incorporated on the PCB. It is somewhat unique in this regard. The project's reception was best discribed as "flat". 5 years too late...  

I spent an age trying to find a case style that I liked, but finally settled for some retro stripes. It's looks a little 70's to me. Apart from expecting the paper thin screen to snap at any point, it was easy enough to put together. Some small RGB LED light bleed issues persist, but I'm happy with the results. 

It will play all the games that were designed for Arduboy®.
